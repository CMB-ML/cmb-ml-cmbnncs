# This patches over pipes_on_sims so that CMB-ML knows where to look
#   as it processes the downgraded Planck dataset.
# Some directories needed are "source only;" no data will be written.
# The following directory structure is assumed.
# ...root/Datasets
#   - Planck as dataset "Planck Dir" (source only)
#   - Dataset used for training
#       - Working directory for training "Training Dir" (source only)
#       - Output when using Planck as dataset with trained model
